# Introduction
This project focuses on enhancing cybersecurity through three distinct tasks:

1. Phishing Attack Detection and Prevention
2. Secure Code Review
3. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

# Tasks Overview
1. Phishing Attack Detection and Prevention
Phishing attacks are a significant threat to online security. In this task, I implemented a solution to detect and prevent phishing attacks using machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes incoming emails and identifies potential phishing attempts by evaluating various features, such as email content, sender information, and URL patterns.

2. Secure Code Review
Secure code review is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of software applications. In this task, I conducted a comprehensive review of the project's codebase to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. The review process involved:

- Static code analysis using automated tools.

- Manual code inspection for potential security flaws.

- Implementation of best practices for secure coding.

3. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
Network intrusion detection is crucial for maintaining the security of an organization's network. In this task, I developed a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that monitors network traffic and detects suspicious activities. The NIDS uses signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques to identify potential threats and generate alerts for further investigation.

# Conclusion
This project aims to enhance cybersecurity by addressing critical areas such as phishing attack detection and prevention, secure code review, and network intrusion detection. By implementing these solutions, we can significantly improve the security posture of an organization and protect it from various cyber threats.
