# Phishing Attack Detection and Prevention

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and preventing phishing attacks using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Real-time phishing detection.
- Uses machine learning algorithms.
- Analyzes email content, sender information, and URLs.

## Detection
The system uses machine learning models to analyze email content and identify potential phishing attempts. By evaluating various features like email body text, sender details, and embedded URLs, it can detect suspicious patterns indicative of phishing.

## Types of Phishing
- **Email Phishing:** Fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources.
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
- **Clone Phishing:** Duplicate of a legitimate email with malicious content.
- **Whaling:** Targeting high-profile individuals like executives with sophisticated phishing schemes.

## Real World Scenarios
- **Workplace Email Compromise:** An employee receives a phishing email disguised as an urgent request from a senior executive, leading to the unauthorized transfer of funds.
- **Account Takeover:** Users receive phishing emails claiming to be from their bank, prompting them to enter their login details on a fake website, resulting in unauthorized access to their accounts.
- **Credential Harvesting:** Phishing emails mimic popular online services, tricking users into providing their credentials, which are then used to access multiple accounts.

## Prevention
- **User Education:** Regular training on recognizing phishing emails.
- **Email Filtering:** Implementing spam filters to detect and block phishing attempts.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adding an extra layer of security to user accounts.
- **Regular Software Updates:** Keeping systems updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.
